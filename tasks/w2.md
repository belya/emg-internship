The goal of MS subproject is to find out is the given dataset applicable to solve the problem proposed by authors. As a reminder, the original problem can be simply formulated as "to diagnose degenerative disease by MUAP form". 

The task for this week is to check the significance (or insignificance) of interconnection between the given feature and the certain disease (MND or Myopathy).

Please look at the description.ipynb file. There is a bunch of hypotheses suggested during the first iteration. Let's split our work in the following manner:

- Aishwarya - 1B, 2B
- Pavan - 2A

To achieve proposed goal, you should use statistical tests to show that the result of your investigation is not accidental, i.e. significant. But any additional materials as explanatory models and visualizations are welcome.
