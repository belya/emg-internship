This week I expect you to achieve the understanding of the suggested task. I.e. to do the following:
1. Download the dataset. Make sure that you are able to load it with pandas or other csv-related package.
2. Describe the target feature "Cls". What disease is represented by each class?
3. Describe the experiment process, and provide the definition of the columns from 1 to 14. 
4. Propose the hypothesis about the dependencies between the features and the target you expect to see during your further study of this dataset. For example:  
"I expect to see bigger values for MUAP amplitude for Myopathy patients, because the MUAP is generated by the motor fibers, and Myopathies reduces their amount in muscle tissues"

The description of target and features is situated on a page 2 of the suggested paper. The hypotheses proposed by authors can be found on a page 4, I expect you to find an explain them. Please do not forget to mention all sources you've used.
